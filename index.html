		</ol>

	<h2>Tech-aquisitor Scaevola</h2>
	<p>Scaevola is a tech-aquisitor from Stygies VIII. She is currently in the service of Magos Dominus Faustinius, and is part of his salvage mission to the newly rediscovered world of Silva Tenebris aborad the Ark Mechanicus, the Caestus Metalican. She encourages Faustinius to lead the expedition in plundering the vaults for new discoveries to further her and Stygies VIII's power. (<a href="https://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Scaevola">Lexicanum</a>) Other members of the operation include:</p>
<!-- Tech-priests on Silva Tenebris -->
		<ul>
			<li>Magos Dominus Faustinius, a surprisingly <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Sigmarxism/comments/rakz4u/your_scheduled_noospheric_reminder_from_comrade/#lightbox"> benevolent leader</a></li>
			<li>Lector-Dogmatic Videx, of Metalica, seeker of purity through destruction of the Xenos influence and thus an <a href="https://i.imgur.com/wylqLLb.png">antithesis to Scaevola's Xenarite doctrine</a></li>
			<li>Subdomina Kephra, a Master of Skitarii, providing a more 'human' outlook as well as a deep concern for th wellbeing of her troops, often a <a href="https://img-9gag-fun.9cache.com/photo/a859Y8Y_460s.jpg">source of dismay</a> from the other Tech-Priests but, notably, <a href="https://imgur.com/a/eNte0GP">respect from Faustinius</a> himself.</li>
